Generalize libraries/interfaces so code for rpi and esp work the same
Presence https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/presence
Need to buffer messages internally, send when there is enough power
How to account for multiple sensors on same pin? Have to handle 1wire, i2c, spi etc
Send "report logs" msg, return last [x] logs from queue

When adding new jobs/sensors:
  Add sensor which is linked to pin, and includes read function.
  Add job which is on schedule, finds sensor by uid, calls read function


Components/services:
  ELK/logging backend
  Nodes
    Solar power
    Wakeup schedule should be minimum frequency of sensor readings
  Sensors
    Physical/electrical
    Reading framework
  Central server
  Frontend, visualization
  Phone app
