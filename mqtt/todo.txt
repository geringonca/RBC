Send "report logs" msg, return last [x] logs from queue
How to account for multiple sensors on same pin? Have to handle 1wire, i2c, spi etc
Set_Name action (might need to restart)
trigger_job should call a sensor/actuator immediately.
If Node is offline/powered down, bridge should queue any sent messages/tasks until the node wakes up

update_firmware: job pulls latest git repo, then restarts node

daemon/service around node process
Push notifications to mobile devices!
Generalize libraries/interfaces so code for rpi and esp work the same
Need to batch/buffer messages internally, send when there is enough power
Update internal clock on wake

  ELK/logging backend
  Nodes
    Solar power
    Wakeup schedule should be minimum frequency of sensor readings
  Sensors
    Physical/electrical
    Reading framework
