RPI ELK
improve on_connect setup
tests
Send "report logs" msg, return last [x] logs from queue
How to account for multiple sensors on same pin? Have to handle 1wire, i2c, spi etc
  Could use spi/i2c address as pin so we can pass that in remotely
Set_Name action (might need to restart)
trigger_job should call a sensor/actuator immediately.
If Node is offline/powered down, bridge should queue any sent messages/tasks until the node wakes up
report internal voltage
update_firmware: job pulls latest git repo, then restarts node

daemon/service around node process
Push notifications to mobile devices!
Generalize libraries/interfaces so code for rpi and esp work the same
Need to batch/buffer messages internally, send when there is enough power
Update internal clock on wake
alerts if too many errors in given time
use more flexible scheduling: daily, set time, etc

Components/services:
  ELK/logging backend
  Nodes
    Solar power
    Wakeup schedule should be minimum frequency of sensor readings
  Sensors
    Physical/electrical
    Reading framework
  Central server
  Frontend, visualization
  Phone app


for id in core sdram_c sdram_i sdram_p ; do  echo -e "$id:\t$(vcgencmd measure_volts $id)" ; done



Connect sensors to node
Upload firmware to node
Add config file to node, specifying which sensors etc
On wake, node reads config and executes jobs as required.
Each job executed writes a timestamp to disk
Node regularly polls manager for config. If different, write it to disk.

Manager is rest/gql app
Node state stored in DB
