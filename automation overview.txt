Use web interface to add new sensor to a remote node.
eg add water sensor:
    type: "water sensor"  # determines code to run on node, and display type on server
    location: "green chili A"  # determines what node to send data to/expect from, and where to draw output on server
    name: "green chili A water sensor"  # autogenerated from above
    pin(s): 4  # what pins connected to sensor on node


node used for "green chili A" is sent this message
declares water sensor on pin 4
adds water sensor task to scheduler
returns water sensor data to server with correct tag so it can be displayed in right place/format



node scheduling
map of tasks/sensors to how often to run them
or a list of tasks/sensor objects which can report whether/when they need to be run.
include a self-report task - report on node condition, whether broken etc
run each task, create a report and out to outbox




server
headless raspberry pi, with nrf24l01
At set intervals, set up comms with each wireless node
ask for report (from outbox)
send any commands needed (eg turn on valve for 10s, declare sensor)
after each round, parse data, generate reports/graphs
determine any actions necessary in next interval
repeat



sensors:
soil moisture
humidity
air temperature
light
pH
barometry
water temperature (for tanks)
water level (for tanks)
compost temperature


actuators
Watering valve (micro-servo/solenoid actuated)
Tank pump
Open/close shades/greenhouses



interface:
See overview of garden - pots, beds, greenhouses, tanks etc
warnings area - for any problems (soil too dry/wet, faulty equipment etc)
notifications area - reminders to do tasks, eg pick fruit, add fertiliser etc
